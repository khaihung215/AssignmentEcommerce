-	Optional (shopping cart, ordering)

For admin:
-	Login/logout
-	Manage product categories (Name, Description)

The project should apply as many techniques of ASP.NET MVC Core as possible. For example: TagHelpers, ViewComponents, Razor Pages and have Unit Test.

The Unit Test do not need to have a high coverage number but should demonstrate the ability to write unit test for common components: Controllers, ViewComponents, Services,â€¦
